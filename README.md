# tutorial-by-DaFluffyPotato
This is where I will keep my progress on what I do from a 6-hour tutorial from DaFluffyPotato. Just in case. This is private by the way

The goal is to finish the tutorial and then add some of my own features to it to make it my own. At the moment, I'm inspired by a game boy itch.io game about collecting Coconuts so I might just try recreating that.

I'll link it later if I can figure out how to do that.

GoodLuck Future Me!
